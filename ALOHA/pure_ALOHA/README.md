# 🚀 Pure ALOHA Protocol Simulator - Python WebSocket Edition 🚀

Welcome to the *most thrilling* Pure ALOHA simulation you’ll ever experience! Whether you're a networking newbie or a seasoned protocol junkie, this project drops you right into the chaotic, collision-packed world of the classic **Pure ALOHA** access method, powered by modern Python and WebSockets magic! 🎉

## 🎯 What Is Pure ALOHA? (The Cool Stuff You Need to Know)

Imagine you and your friends shouting messages across a crowded room with zero coordination — just yell whenever you want! That’s Pure ALOHA in a nutshell. 

Pure ALOHA is one of the earliest random access protocols designed for shared communication channels. Here’s the lowdown:

- 🕒 **No scheduling or slots:** Devices transmit whenever they want.
- 💥 **Collisions happen often:** If two devices transmit at the same time (or overlapping windows), their messages get garbled.
- 🔄 **Backoff / Retry:** When a collision happens, devices wait a random time before trying again.
- 📉 **About 18% efficiency:** Yep, Pure ALOHA wastes a lot of airtime but it’s super simple!

This project simulates a multi-client environment where virtual devices send messages at random times to a server. The server listens, detects collisions within a "collision window," and tells clients to back off or celebrates successful transmissions.

## 🛠 Features & What You’ll See
- **Multiple clients** sending data asynchronously.
- **Server-side collision detection** with real-time feedback.
- Randomized retry/backoff logic mimicking real network chaos.
- Built with Python's asyncio and the modern `websockets` library.
- Clear, easy-to-understand console outputs that *actually make sense.*

## 🔥 Installation & Setup (Get Ready to Dive In)
Ready to test your nerves with packet collisions? Here's how to get started:

### 1. Clone The Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pure-aloha-simulator.git
cd pure-aloha-simulator
```

### 2. Create & Activate Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS
..venv\Scripts\activate # Windows PowerShell
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note:* The key dependency is `websockets`. Make sure you’re using Python 3.10+ for best compatibility.

## 🚦 Running The Simulator

### Start The Server
```bash
python server.py
```
Watch the server initialize and listen at `ws://localhost:8765`.

### Fire Up One or More Clients
Open new terminals and run:
```bash
python client.py
```
Each client acts like a frantic chatterbox, randomly shouting packets. The server will catch collisions and signal backoffs or a cheerful ACK!

---

## 📜 How It Works — Step by Step

1. **Clients pick random moments** to send packets.
2. The **server timestamps each arrival** and compares currently queued packets.
3. If **multiple packets overlap within the 0.5-second collision window**, everyone involved hears a stern “COLLISION detected!” 👊
4. Collided clients **wait a random backoff time** before trying again, avoiding chaos... momentarily.
5. Solo transmissions get a friendly **“ACK: Packet transmitted successfully!”** — mission accomplished! 🎯

## 💡 Why Pure ALOHA Still Matters
While rarely used directly today, Pure ALOHA laid the foundation for smarter protocols like Slotted ALOHA and Ethernet's CSMA/CD. Studying Pure ALOHA teaches us the basics of *random access*, *collision detection*, and how network protocols handle conflict and fairness.

If you love diving into networking history mixed with practical coding, you’re in the right place.
