# 🚀⚡ SLOTTED ALOHA PROTOCOL SIMULATION ⚡🚀

> **WARNING:**  
> This is a simulation for educational purposes only!  
> Do **NOT** use in production environments.  
> ⚠️ Collisions ahead! ⚠️

## 🛰️ What is Slotted ALOHA?

> **Slotted ALOHA** is a futuristic (well, 1970s-futuristic) protocol for sharing a communication channel.  
> It divides time into slots, and clients can only transmit at the start of a slot.  
> This reduces chaos (collisions), but not all of it.  
> If two or more clients transmit in the same slot: **BOOM! COLLISION!**

**Key Features:**
- ⏱️ Time is divided into slots.
- 🚦 Clients transmit only at the start of a slot.
- 💥 Collisions occur if multiple clients transmit in the same slot.
- 🔁 Colliding clients back off for a random number of slots.

## 📁 FILE STRUCTURE

```
slotted_ALOHA/
├── Client.py      # The futuristic client node (run multiple!)
├── Server.py      # The central server (the channel overlord)
├── README.md      # This file, your guide to the future
└── (other utils)  # Any extra scripts/utilities you add
```

---

## 🛠️ HOW TO RUN

1. **Start the Server (in one terminal):**
   ```bash
   python3 Server.py
   ```

2. **Start one or more Clients (each in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   python3 Client.py
   ```

3. **Watch the console:**  
   - Successful transmissions and **COLLISIONS** will be displayed in glorious ASCII.

## ⚙️ REQUIREMENTS

- Python 3.7+ (the language of the future)
- `websockets` library  
  Install with:
  ```bash
  pip install websockets
  ```

---

## ⚡ NOTICES & TIPS

- 🧪 **Experiment:** Tweak slot durations and backoff times in the code to see how the protocol behaves!
- 🧑‍💻 **Educational:** This is a simulation, not a real network stack.
- 🛑 **No Warranty:** Use at your own risk. Collisions are part of the fun.
- 🤖 **Futuristic:** ASCII art included at no extra charge.

## 🧬 PROTOCOL FLOW (ASCII STYLE)

```
[CLIENT] --(packet)--> [SERVER]
   |                        |
   |<--(ACK/Collision)------|
   |                        |
[If collision: random backoff, then retry]
```

## 🏗️ FUTURE IDEAS

- Add a GUI with blinking lights!  
- Simulate more protocols (CSMA/CD, Token Ring, etc.)
- Add logging and analytics for nerdy stats.
